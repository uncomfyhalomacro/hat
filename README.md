# hat

Simple cat-clone written in https://harelang.org

## Installation

Install to `/usr/local`

```sh
sudo make install
```

Install to another directory

```sh
[sudo] make PREFIX=<directory> install 
```

It's too simple since it's just based on the hare tutorial. I don't know what features to add yet.
